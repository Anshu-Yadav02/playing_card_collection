Title
REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Objective
Build a RESTful API using Express.js to manage a collection of playing cards. This task helps you understand routing, handling HTTP methods, and basic data manipulation in a Node.js backend environment.

Task Description
Create an Express.js server that provides API endpoints to manage a playing card collection. The API should allow you to perform operations such as listing all cards, adding a new card (with properties like suit and value), retrieving a specific card by ID, and deleting a card by ID. Store card data in an in-memory array for simplicity. The API should follow RESTful principles and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) clearly, responding with appropriate JSON data.
